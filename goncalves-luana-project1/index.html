		<h2 id="what">What is SUP?</h2>
		<p><strong>Stand up paddle surfing</strong> and <strong>stand up paddle boarding</strong> (SUP), (<em>Hoe he'e nalu</em> in the Hawaiian language) are sports originating in Hawaii as an off-shoot of surfing. They enable surfers to paddle farther into the ocean than is typical or to paddle standing up as a sport unto itself. A 2013 report called it the outdoor sporting activity with the most first-time participants of any in the United States that year.[1] Paddlers race on lakes, large rivers and canals, ride breaking waves, and glide over long distances along sea coasts, often using tail winds to aid the trip.</p>
		<p>Stand up paddlers wear a variety of wet suits and other clothing, depending on both water and air temperature since most of their time is spent standing on the board.</p>
		<p>A related, traditional sport, paddleboarding, is done kneeling on a board and paddling with the hands, similar to a butterfly swimming stroke. The term <q>paddleboarding</q> is sometimes incorrectly used to refer to stand up paddle surfing.</p>
		<p>Historian and writer Steve West, notes that the contemporary notion of stand up paddle boarding, if attributed to the Waikiki Beach Boys of Oahu during the 1960s, considers that outrigger canoeing should in fact be recognized as the direct link between the idea of standing on a board and propelling it with a canoe paddle, seeing as these two primary skills (board riding and paddling) were merely being combined, by people who had traditionally grown up around both skills as part of their cultural right of passage.</p>

		<h2 id="reasons">Reasons you should SUP</h2>
		<p>Besides <abbr title="Stand Up Paddle Boarding">SUP</abbr> being a fun sport, here are the reasons why you should SUP:</p>
		<ol>
			<li><strong>It is not as hard as it looks.</strong> <abbr title="Stand Up Paddle Boarding">SUP</abbr> boards are wider and longer than a surfboard making it easier to stand and stay balanced on the board. It does require a little bit of upper body strength and agility, but  simply knowing the appropriate techniques, you can easily be navigating open water without worrying about falling all over the place. You can also paddle by staying on your knees too!</li>
			<li><strong>You get to exercise while sightseeing. </strong><abbr title="Stand Up Paddle Boarding">SUP</abbr> can be a great workout that can bring many health benefits. You can paddle fast or you can paddle slow, either way you’re getting your cardio done while working most of your upper, core and lower body muscles. And to get your mind off the burn, you get to sightsee all the oceanic nature surrounding you! Who knows, you might get lucky and have dolphins swim by your board.</li>
			<li><strong>It's stress-relieving.</strong> Besides all the fun that comes with <abbr title="Stand Up Paddle Boarding">SUP</abbr>, you get to relax. Got a lot on your mind? Had a rough week at work? Just paddling out to the ocean will help melt that stress away. Enjoy doing yoga? Try to practice on a SUP board!</li>

		<h2 id="materials">Materials and Design</h2>
		<p>New <abbr title="Stand Up Paddle Boarding">SUP</abbr> board prices range from US$600 to US$1500, and most use glass-reinforced plastic construction using polyester or epoxy resin that is compatible with the polyurethane or expanded polystyrene foam used in the core. Some SUP boards use a hollow wood construction instead of foam with epoxy resin.[11] In the last few years inflatable boards have been introduced as well. The boards are generally longer than 9 feet (2,7 <abbr title="meters">m</abbr>), and can be longer than 12 feet (3,6 <abbr title="meters">m</abbr>), with features such as padded decks and concave hulls; they generally have one or three surfboard-style fins in the stern for tracking.</p>
		<p>River specific stand up paddle boards are starting to experiment with different fabrics, and polymers for the abuse the board takes in the river.[12]</p>
